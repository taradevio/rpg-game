# Order of The Wild: Lingo

## Background
This project was created as one of my ways to contribute back to society, especially in English. I could not not a fitting and simple idea to share my knowledge, then this project idea came to life. It was inspired by *menfess* English community on Twitter that had me thinking if I could create an alternative to create a simple English website with an engaging experience. Since I had been interested in RPG game, I was thinking if I could incorporate some of its mechanisms into my website

## Problems
Creating this project was theoretically straightforward. However, it doesn't mean that there were no problems faced. Some of which are:
- Game-like user interface
- Game stories
- State management for health, scores, questions, lose condition, win condition, and game loop

Some solutions I worked on:
- Created an interface, having background images which are overlayed by texts
- Created simple fantasy stories to keep the users engaged
- Utilized immutable variable to unbound each variable from conflicting with different scenarios which would cause bugs

These solutions may not be the best ones, but these could still be improved later on in the future and perhaps adding more features, such as new stories, new type of English questions, and even choices!
